# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple personal portfolio website primarily designed to practice and demonstrate **cloud deployment** skills and **CI/CD automation**.

## About the Project

- The website currently hosts my resume and a brief introduction.  
- The main goal of this project was to learn how to deploy a website using **Firebase Hosting** on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
- I set up **automated continuous deployment** with **GitHub Actions** to streamline updates whenever I push new changes.  
- While the website looks clean and functional, the focus is more on mastering cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and automation workflows than on detailed website content or design.  
- I plan to continuously improve and enhance the siteâ€™s design, interactivity, and content over time.

## Technologies Used

- Firebase Hosting (Google Cloud Platform)  
- GitHub and GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  
- HTML and CSS
